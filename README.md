# PcapParser Documentation

## Introduction

PcapParser is a powerful tool for analyzing PCAP (Packet Capture) files and extracting valuable information from them. PCAP files are commonly used to capture and store network traffic data, and PcapParser makes it easy to process these files, extract specific data elements like IP addresses, URLs, and hashed data, and present the results in a structured format.

## Installation

To use PcapParser, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If you don't have them, you can download and install them from the official Node.js website: [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org).

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, follow these steps to set up PcapParser:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alienblack/PcapParser.git
   cd PcapParser
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

PcapParser can be used from the command line to analyze PCAP files and extract specific data elements. The basic usage is as follows:

```bash
node index.js -f /path/to/pcap/file.pcap
```

### Options

- `-f`, `--file` - Specify the path to the PCAP file you want to analyze. This option is required.

- `-o`, `--output` - Specify the output format for the extracted data. Available options are `json` (default), `csv`, and `text`.

- `-i`, `--ip` - Filter and extract only IP addresses from the PCAP file.

- `-u`, `--url` - Filter and extract only URLs from the PCAP file.

- `-h`, `--hash` - Filter and extract only hashed data from the PCAP file.

### Examples

1. Extract all data (IP addresses, URLs, and hashed data) from a PCAP file and save the output as JSON:

   ```bash
   node index.js -f /path/to/pcap/file.pcap
   ```

2. Extract only IP addresses from a PCAP file and save the output as CSV:

   ```bash
   node index.js -f /path/to/pcap/file.pcap -o csv -i
   ```

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: PcapParser can extract IP addresses, URLs, and hashed data from PCAP files, making it easy to identify relevant information from network traffic captures.

- **Customizable Output**: You can choose the output format for the extracted data, including JSON, CSV, or plain text, based on your requirements.

- **Filtering Options**: PcapParser allows you to filter the data extraction process to focus on specific types of data elements, such as IP addresses, URLs, or hashed data.
